 presents the flowchart of the Genetic Algorithm process designed for comparative analysis across different selection strategies. The algorithm initiates with a randomly generated population and evaluates fitness values based on the objective function. In each generation, diversity is monitored, and if stagnation occurs, the mutation parameters are adaptively modified. Depending on the variant selected (standard, elitist, or tournament), parents are chosen to undergo crossover and mutation operations to produce the next generation. The algorithm employs early stopping if convergence is detected, ultimately returning the best solution along with the fitness and diversity trends across generations.
